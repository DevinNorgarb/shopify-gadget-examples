This is a related products picker for e-commerce merchants to select which products should be displayed together on their website.
This is the administration interface frontend built in next.js. This UI saves data to a Gadget backend, which then writes data to a Shopify store powering the actual storefront.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
